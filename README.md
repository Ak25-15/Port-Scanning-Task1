## 🖥️ Hosts Summary

### 🟢 10.0.2.2 — Likely Windows Host
- **Open Ports:**
  - `135/tcp` - Microsoft Windows RPC
  - `445/tcp` - SMB (Microsoft-ds)
  - `3580/tcp` - NI LabVIEW Service Locator
  - `8080/tcp` - Embedthis HTTP Server
- **Service Detection:**
  - NI Service Locator 1.0.0
  - Embedthis HTTP lib httpd
- **OS Guess:**
  - Possibly running on **VirtualBox/QEMU/Slirp**
  - Detected OS: Windows (Microsoft CPE)
- **Security Note:** SMB signing is enabled but not required

---

### 🟢 10.0.2.3 — Likely DNS Server or Router
- **Open Port:**
  - `53/tcp` - DNSMasq 2.52
- **Service Detection:**
  - DNS version info exposed via `dns-nsid`
- **OS Guess:**
  - Possibly running on **VirtualBox/QEMU/Slirp**, or embedded systems (printer/router)
- **Security Note:** Only port 53 open, others filtered by firewall (likely air-gapped)

---

### 🟢 10.0.2.15 — Linux Host (SSH Server)
- **Open Port:**
  - `22/tcp` - OpenSSH 9.9p2 (Debian)
- **OS Detection:**
  - Linux kernel versions `2.6.32 - 6.2`
  - High confidence in OS as general-purpose Linux
- **Security Note:** HTTP/HTTPS explicitly closed
